Configuration
-------------

The path to a config file can be given via the *$imv_config* environment
variable. If not found, imv will search for it in the following locations:

- $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/imv/config (recommended)
- $HOME/.config/imv/config
- $HOME/.imv_config
- $HOME/.imv/config
- /usr/local/etc/imv_config
- /etc/imv_config

A default config file is shipped with imv into /etc/imv_config

For documentation on the config file format, see **imv**(5).

Environment Variables
---------------------

When imv executes a shell command, it provides a number of environment variables,
exposing imv's state. These environment variables are also available when
customising the window's title, or the overlay text.

*$imv_current_file*::
	Path of currently selected image.

*$imv_scaling_mode*::
	Name of the current scaling mode.

*$imv_loading*::
	1 if a new image is loading, 0 otherwise.

*$imv_current_index*::
	Index of current image, from 1-N.

*$imv_file_count*::
	Total number of files.

*$imv_width*::
	Width of the current image.

*$imv_height*::
	Height of the current image.

*$imv_scale*::
	Scaling of current image in percent.

*$imv_slideshow_duration*::
	Number of seconds each image is shown for.

*$imv_slideshow_elapsed*::
	How long the current image has been shown for.

IPC
---

imv can accept commands from another process over a unix socket. Each instance
of imv will open a unix socket named '$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/imv-$PID.sock'. If
$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR is undefined, the socket is placed into '/tmp/' instead.

The **imv-msg**(1) utility is provided to simpliy this from shell scripts.
