Name
----
imv-dir - Open 'imv' for all images in a directory

Description
-----------

'imv-dir' is a wrapper for 'imv' that auto-selects the directory where the image is located, so that the *next* and *previous* commands function in the same way as other image viewers.

Note that this wrapper supports only a single image. For opening multiple images, use plain `imv`.
