Name

imv - Image viewer for X11 and Wayland

Description
-----------

imv is an image viewer for X11 and Wayland, aimed at users of tiling window
managers. It supports a wide variety of image file formats, including animated
gif files. imv will automatically reload the current image, if it is changed on
disk.

Synopsis
--------
'imv' [options] [paths...]

Options
-------

*-h*::
	Show help message and quit.

*-v*::
	Show version and quit.

*-b* <background>::
	Set the background colour. Can either be a 6-digit hexadecimal colour code
	or 'checks' to show a chequered background.

*-c* <command>::
	Specify a command to be run on launch, after the configuration has been
	loaded. Can be used to configure custom keys with the bind command. This

	Start with overlay visible.

*-f*::
	Start fullscreen.

*-l*::
	List open files to stdout at exit.

*-n* <path|index>::
	Start with the given path, or index selected.

*-r*::
	Load directories recursively.

*-s* <none|shrink|full>::
	Set scaling mode to use. 'none' will show each image at its actual size.
	'shrink' will scale down the image to fit inside the window. 'full' will
	both scale up and scale down the image to fit perfectly inside the window.
	Defaults to 'full'.

*-t* <slideshow_duration>::
	Start in slideshow mode, with each image shown for the given number of
	seconds.

*-u* <linear|nearest_neighbour>::
	Set upscaling method used by imv.

*-x*::
	Disable looping of input paths.

Commands
--------

Commands can be entered by pressing *:*. imv supports the following commands:

*quit*::
	Quit imv. Aliased to 'q'.

*prev* <offset>::
	Move backwards by a given number of images. Aliased to 'p'

*goto* <index>::
	Select an image by index. '1' is the first image, '2' the second, etc.
	The last image can be indexed as '-1', the second last as '-2'.
	Aliased to 'g'.

*zoom* <amount|'actual'>::
	Zoom into the image by the given amount. Negative values zoom out.
	'actual' resets the zoom to 100%, showing the image at its actual size.
	Aliased to 'z'.

*rotate* <'to'|'by'> <angle>::
	Rotate image clockwise by/to the given amount in degrees.

*flip* <'horizontal'|'vertical'>::
	Flip image horizontally/vertically (across vertical/horizontal axis).

	a 6-digit hexadecimal color code. Aliased to 'bg'.

Configuration
-------------

The path to a config file can be given via the *$imv_config* environment
variable. If not found, imv will search for it in the following locations:

- $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/imv/config (recommended)
- $HOME/.config/imv/config
- $HOME/.imv_config
- $HOME/.imv/config
- /usr/local/etc/imv_config
- /etc/imv_config

A default config file is shipped with imv into /etc/imv_config

For documentation on the config file format, see **imv**(5).

Environment Variables
---------------------

When imv executes a shell command, it provides a number of environment variables,
exposing imv's state. These environment variables are also available when
customising the window's title, or the overlay text.

*$imv_pid*::
	The pid of this instance of imv. Useful for running imv-msg in scripts.

*$imv_current_file*::
	Path of currently selected image.

*$imv_scaling_mode*::
	Name of the current scaling mode.

*$imv_loading*::
	1 if a new image is loading, 0 otherwise.

*$imv_current_index*::
	Index of current image, from 1-N.

*$imv_file_count*::
	Total number of files.

*$imv_width*::
	Width of the current image.

*$imv_height*::
	Height of the current image.

*$imv_scale*::
	Scaling of current image in percent.

*$imv_slideshow_duration*::
	Number of seconds each image is shown for.

*$imv_slideshow_elapsed*::
	How long the current image has been shown for.

IPC
---

imv can accept commands from another process over a unix socket. Each instance
of imv will open a unix socket named '$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/imv-$PID.sock'. If
$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR is undefined, the socket is placed into '/tmp/' instead.

The **imv-msg**(1) utility is provided to simpliy this from shell scripts.
