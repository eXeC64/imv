Name
----
imv - imv configuration file

Description
-----------

imv can be customised with this configuration file, changing its default
behaviour, key bindings, and appearance.

The imv configuration file is an ini-style file, with multiple 'key = value'
settings, separated into several '[section]'s.

Options
-------

The *[options]* section accepts the following settings:

*background* = <hex-code|'checks'>::
	Set the background in imv. Can either be a 6-digit hexadecimal colour code,
	or 'checks' for a chequered background. Defaults to '000000'

*fullscreen* = <true|false>::
	Start imv fullscreen. Defaults to 'false'.

*list_files_at_exit* = <true|false>::
	Print open files to stdout at exit, each on a separate line.
	Defaults to 'false'.

*loop_input* = <true|false>::
	Return to first image after viewing the last one. Defaults to 'true'.

*overlay* = <true|false>::
	Start with the overlay visible. Defaults to 'false'.

*overlay_font* = <typeface:size>::
	Use the specified font in the overlay. Defaults to 'Monospace:24'.

*overlay_text* = <text>::
	Use the given text as the overlay's text. The provided text is shell
	expanded, so the output of commands can be used: '$(ls)' as can environment
	variables, including the ones accessible to imv's 'exec' command.

*recursively* = <true|false>::
	Load input paths recursively. Defaults to 'false'.

*scaling_mode* = <none|shrink|full>::
	Set scaling mode to use. 'none' will show each image at its actual size.
	'shrink' will scale down the image to fit inside the window. 'full' will
	both scale up and scale down the image to fit perfectly inside the window.
	Defaults to 'full'.

*slideshow_duration* = <duration>::
	Start imv in slideshow mode, and set the amount of time to show each image
	for in seconds. Defaults to '0', i.e. no slideshow.

*stay_fullscreen_on_focus_loss* = <true|false>::
	Stay full screen even when imv loses focus. Defaults to 'false'.

*suppess_default_binds* = <true|false>::
	Disable imv's built-in binds so they don't conflict with custom ones.
	Defaults to 'false'.

*title_text* = <text>::
	Use the given text as the window's title. The provided text is shell
	expanded, so the output of commands can be used: '$(ls)' as can environment
	variables, including the ones accessible to imv's 'exec' command.

*upscaling_method* = <linear|nearest_neighbour>::
	Use the specified method to upscale images. Defaults to 'linear'.

Aliases
-------

The *[aliases]* section allows imv's commands to be aliases. For example:
'q = quit' would add a 'q' command that simply executes the 'quit' command.
And 'next = select_rel 1' would add a 'next' command to imv.

Binds
-----

The *[binds]* section allows custom key bindings to be added to imv.

Binds are in the format 'key combination = command'. A key combination can
consist of multiple keys in succession.

Single keys such as 'q' are just that: 'q = quit' will bind the 'q' key to the
'quit' command.

Modifier keys can be specified by prefixing them: 'Ctrl+q', 'Meta+f',
'Shift+g'. If multiple modifier keys are desired, they are specified in the
order 'Ctrl+Meta+Shift'. When a key's name is more than a single character,
or a modifier is used it must be wrapped in '<' and '>', for example:
'<Ctrl+q>'.

Multiple keys in succession can be specified by listing them in order:
'gg = select_abs 0' will bind two presses of the 'g' key to jump to the first
image, and '<Ctrl+a>p = exec echo hi' will bind the key sequence of 'Ctrl+a'
followed by 'p' to executing the shell command 'echo hi'.

N.B. Special characters such as '!' are not named directly, and are accessed
by their regular key, combined with the shift modifier: 'Shift+1'.

Some keys, such as '<', and '>' have special names, to avoid conflits with
the bind syntax, or the config file format. Other keys with no character
associated with them, such as the 'Return' key or the arrow keys also have
special names. These are as follows:

*Application*::
